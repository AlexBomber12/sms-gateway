Goal: Eliminate socat Broken pipe noise, remove concurrent port probing while gammu-smsd is running, implement a real modem self-healing watchdog with backoff, and make configuration consistent.

Context: Repo contains entrypoint.sh, docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, docs, and tests. Current entrypoint.sh uses socat|grep -q against /dev/ttyUSB0 (hardcoded) and calls reset_usb_modem that is not defined. Healthcheck in compose currently calls gammu identify and can contend with gammu-smsd.

Tasks:
1) Refactor entrypoint.sh:
- Remove check_modem() AT probing via socat and remove or clean unused watchdog_loop().
- Implement reset_usb_modem() with robust detection of USB VID/PID:
  - Prefer explicit USB_VID and USB_PID env vars.
  - Else derive VID and PID from MODEM_PORT via /sys/class/tty traversal when possible.
  - Else fallback to lsusb matching common modem keywords.
- Implement a watchdog based on gammu-smsd output (not probing the port):
  - Start gammu-smsd and monitor its logs.
  - Track consecutive modem timeout patterns (e.g. TIMEOUT, No response in specified timeout, Probably the phone is not connected, Already hit 250 errors).
  - On threshold, stop gammu-smsd, reset USB (usb_modeswitch, plus optional sysfs unbind and bind if available), then restart full detection.
  - Add backoff: minimum interval between resets, and avoid restart storms.
- Modem detection:
  - Support MODEM_PORT if provided.
  - Otherwise scan /dev/serial/by-id, /dev/serial/by-path, and /dev/ttyUSB devices.
  - Use timeout gammu identify to validate.
- generate_config():
  - Ensure smsd config includes DeleteAfterReceive=yes, MultipartTimeout=600, CheckSecurity=0, spool paths, RunOnReceive.
  - Separate logging: LOGLEVEL stays for Python, introduce GAMMU_DEBUGLEVEL (numeric) for gammu-smsd debuglevel. Preserve backward compatibility by accepting numeric LOGLEVEL as gammu debuglevel if GAMMU_DEBUGLEVEL not set.

2) Update or add unit tests as needed:
- Keep existing CI_MODE behavior intact (entrypoint should skip modem work and tail).
- Ensure shellcheck still passes.
- Add a small test that reset_usb_modem function exists (or that entrypoint no longer references an undefined function).

3) Ensure no more socat Broken pipe messages are produced by the script logic itself.

Commands to run:
- shellcheck entrypoint.sh
- pytest -q (CI_MODE=true)

Success criteria:
- entrypoint.sh contains no socat-based port probing loop.
- reset_usb_modem is implemented and referenced correctly.
- MODEM_PORT is not hardcoded to /dev/ttyUSB0 anywhere.
- generate_config includes DeleteAfterReceive and MultipartTimeout.
- All existing tests pass (or updated tests pass) and shellcheck passes.
