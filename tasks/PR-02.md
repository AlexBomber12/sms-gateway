Goal: Make healthcheck non-intrusive and fix USB device mapping in docker-compose.

Tasks:
1) Update docker-compose.yml:
- Replace /dev/usb mapping with /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb.
- Replace healthcheck command that runs `gammu identify` with a non-intrusive check:
  - Example: verify gammu-smsd process exists and /tmp/gammu-smsdrc exists (and optional heartbeat file is fresh if implemented in PR-01).

2) Keep compose.ci.yml behavior unchanged.

3) Update tests if necessary:
- If there are any local modem-dependent tests, keep them skippable in CI.
- Align any existing expectations with the new healthcheck behavior.

Commands to run:
- docker compose config
- pytest -q (CI_MODE=true)

Success criteria:
- Healthcheck does not call gammu identify or touch the modem device.
- Compose uses /dev/bus/usb mapping.
- No CI regressions.
