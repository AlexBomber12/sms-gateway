Goal: Remove broken or inaccurate cron watchdog that tries to call Docker from inside the container.

Tasks:
1) Update Dockerfile:
- Remove cron package installation.
- Remove copying or installation of smsgw-watchdog.sh and smsgw-watchdog.cron.

2) Update entrypoint.sh:
- Remove any `service cron start` (or equivalent) startup call.

3) Update docs:
- docs/README.md and main README.md must no longer describe cron watchdog inside the image.
- Document the actual watchdog approach (from PR-01) as the supported mechanism.

Commands to run:
- docker build
- pytest -q (CI_MODE=true)

Success criteria:
- Image no longer includes cron and no longer schedules smsgw-watchdog.*.
- Documentation matches behavior.
- CI passes.
