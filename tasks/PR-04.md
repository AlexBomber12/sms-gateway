Goal: Provide reproducible host-level hardening guidance to prevent USB modem dropouts.

Tasks:
1) Add docs/host-setup.md covering:
- Disable USB autosuspend for the modem via udev rule (template included).
- ModemManager:
  - Document disabling globally, and
  - Document ignoring only the modem device via udev tagging, with risks and tradeoffs.
- Recommend using /dev/serial/by-id as MODEM_PORT for stable device paths.
- Notes on powered USB hub, stable cabling, and power.

2) Add scripts/host/ with:
- 99-sms-gateway-modem-power.rules template.
- Optional systemd service and timer to reset modem if needed (document as optional second layer).

Success criteria:
- Docs are clear, step-by-step, and match Linux server reality.
- Scripts are present and referenced from docs.
