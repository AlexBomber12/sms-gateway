Goal: Final cleanup to prevent cross-platform issues, restore LOGLEVEL compatibility, remove legacy watchdog artifacts, and align docs with real runtime behavior.

Context:
- All PR-01..PR-06 features are implemented.
- The repo contains Windows NTFS Alternate Data Stream artifacts like `*:Zone.Identifier` which can break cloning or checkout on Windows.
- Python logging currently reads LOGLEVEL from env; if LOGLEVEL is numeric (historical usage for gammu debug), Python logging can crash with "Unknown level".
- Legacy watchdog files (smsgw-watchdog.sh, smsgw-watchdog.cron) are no longer part of the intended architecture but may still be present and referenced by scripts.
- README examples should match the actual entrypoint logs to reduce debugging friction.

Tasks:
1) Remove Zone.Identifier artifacts and prevent reintroduction:
- Delete any files matching `*:Zone.Identifier` from the repository.
- Ensure none of these files are tracked by git:
  - `git ls-files | grep -F "Zone.Identifier"` must return nothing.
- Add to .gitignore:
  - `*:Zone.Identifier`
- Optional but recommended:
  - Add a small note in docs explaining why these files are ignored (Windows ADS artifacts).

2) Fix Python LOGLEVEL parsing with backwards compatibility:
- Implement a shared helper for parsing the LOGLEVEL env var used by Python logging.
- Requirements:
  - Accept standard names: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, NOTSET (case-insensitive).
  - If LOGLEVEL is numeric (e.g. "1", "10", "20"), convert to int and use it as logging level.
  - If LOGLEVEL is missing or invalid, default to INFO without crashing.
- Apply the helper consistently to all Python entrypoints that call logging.basicConfig:
  - on_receive.py
  - queue_worker.py (or equivalent worker script)
  - any other scripts that configure logging from env
- Add unit tests for the helper:
  - named levels, mixed case, numeric values, invalid values, default behavior.

3) Remove legacy cron-based watchdog artifacts and update tooling:
- Remove smsgw-watchdog.sh and smsgw-watchdog.cron from the repository if they are no longer used.
- Update scripts/run_tests.sh (and any other CI or local scripts) so it does not reference or shellcheck removed legacy files.
- If the legacy files must remain for historical reference, move them under scripts/host/legacy/ and ensure:
  - They are excluded from the Docker image build via .dockerignore (preferred), or
  - They are not referenced by any runtime or test scripts.
- Ensure Dockerfile and entrypoint do not start cron and do not install cron.

4) Documentation alignment:
- Update README and docs so example logs and troubleshooting instructions match the current entrypoint output and behavior:
  - Remove outdated lines and add real log markers users will see.
  - Ensure troubleshooting mentions:
    - Non-intrusive healthcheck behavior
    - Built-in watchdog behavior
    - Host hardening link (docs/host-setup.md)
- Keep upgrade notes accurate.

Commands to run:
- scripts/run_tests.sh
- pytest -q (CI_MODE=true)
- shellcheck on any remaining shell scripts
- git status
- git ls-files | grep -F "Zone.Identifier" (must return nothing)

Success criteria:
- No `*:Zone.Identifier` files exist in the repo and they are ignored by git.
- Python processes do not crash when LOGLEVEL is numeric and logs still work correctly for named levels.
- Legacy watchdog artifacts are removed or quarantined and not referenced by tests or runtime.
- README and docs reflect real runtime logs and troubleshooting steps.
- scripts/run_tests.sh exits with code 0.
