# Tasks

Task files live in this folder and follow the `PR-XX.md` naming pattern (zero-padded number with a short title in the file header).
Each task file must follow `tasks/PR-TEMPLATE.md` so agents can process work deterministically.

Create new tasks by copying the template and filling in each section.
