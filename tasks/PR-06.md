Goal: Finish the project cleanly with coherent configuration, documentation, and small CI improvements.

Tasks:
1) Update .env.example:
- Add GAMMU_DEBUGLEVEL, DELIVERY_MODE, and watchdog tunables with sensible defaults.
- Keep existing variables and document precedence rules.

2) Update README:
- Quick start.
- Verification steps.
- Troubleshooting:
  - How to read logs,
  - Typical modem issues and what auto-recovery does,
  - Host hardening checklist (link to docs/host-setup.md).
- Upgrade notes from previous versions.

3) CI improvements:
- Keep current workflow, but add minimal sanity checks:
  - Python compile check (python -m py_compile on project modules) if not already present.
  - Shellcheck is already present, keep it.
- Ensure CI_MODE paths remain stable.

Success criteria:
- Repo is self-explanatory for a new user.
- CI remains green.
- Upgrade path is documented.
