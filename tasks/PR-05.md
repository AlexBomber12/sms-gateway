Goal: Ensure SMS reception remains stable when Telegram is slow or unavailable by avoiding long RunOnReceive blocking.

Tasks:
1) Implement queue mode:
- Modify the on_receive handling so RunOnReceive quickly enqueues message payload to a durable file queue:
  - Write to a temp file, then atomic rename into a pending directory.
- Add a worker process (Python) that:
  - Reads queue items,
  - Sends to Telegram with retries,
  - Marks items as sent or failed without data loss.
- Introduce env DELIVERY_MODE=direct|queue:
  - Default direct for backwards compatibility.

2) Update entrypoint and config:
- If DELIVERY_MODE=queue:
  - Start worker in background,
  - Set RunOnReceive to enqueue script.
- Keep direct mode unchanged.

3) Add tests:
- Unit test enqueue behavior.
- Unit test worker retry logic using mocks.
- Verify that direct mode still sends immediately.

Success criteria:
- When Telegram is unreachable, RunOnReceive returns quickly and queue grows.
- Once Telegram is reachable, queued messages are delivered.
- Existing direct mode remains unchanged by default.
- Tests pass.
